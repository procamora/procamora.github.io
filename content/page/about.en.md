My name is Pablo and I am a computer engineer who is specializing in cybersecurity and ethical hacking through a master's degree. My main hobbies are programming and electronics.

When I was a child I liked to disassemble objects to understand how they work and, although at that time I did not usually manage to reassemble them correctly, now I usually do.

During my academic stage, I spent more hours researching on my own concepts related to those seen in class than the syllabus that was taught, so my classmates consulted me the doubts that arose.

I am a person who loves to face new challenges and to be constantly learning. If anything defines me is the DIY (Do it yourself) culture.



My main hard skills are:

- Vulnerability analysis and pentesting.
- Firewall configuration.
- Risk management and network auditing.
- Information Cybersecurity: Authorization and Access Control.
- Configuration of Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems.
- Linux Operating Systems Administration.
- Knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Java and C/C++.
- Design of projects based on embedded systems such as Arduino.
- Network administration and management.
- Development of REST Web Services.
- Development of Relational and Non-Relational Databases. 

My main soft skills are:

- Team work
- Resolving capacity
- Ability to adapt and learn
- Analytical thinking
- Creativity
